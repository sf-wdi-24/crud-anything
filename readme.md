**Objective:** Your weekend lab is to make something using all the aspects of CRUD. It's up to you to come up with an idea, but it must have **a model, views, controllers, and routes** to `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete` at least one resource.

**NOTE** you don't need to add users and authentication. Actually, don't add authentication just to fulfill the CRUD requirement because that would be boring.

In addition, you are **required to use a gem or feature of Rails which hasn't been covered explicitly in class**.

## Dev Job Bulletin

As a full stack developer, I would like to create a job bulletin where other developers can share jobs they they know or find a job. Even though there are many of job search websites, Dev Job Bulletin only focus on Coding industry and it's FREE for anyone who want to post a job here. Users can create a new job, create or delete there own posted job(s). Users looking for a jobs, can search the jobs other posted in the bulletin using Bulletin Search engine, or they can search jobs on Indeed using Indeed Search.

## Gems Used

* ElasticSearch
* Bootstrap Sass
* Will Paginate
* Indeed API

## Heroku Link
